# ThreatForge

## Overview
ThreatForge is a comprehensive, modular game engine for simulating modern global threats through educational and entertaining strategy/simulation experiences. The engine supports simulation across multiple threat domains including cyber, biological, environmental, quantum, radiological, and robotic dangers.

## Core Components
- **Modular Architecture**: Plugin-based design for threat domains
- **Faction System**: Asymmetric roles with unique capabilities
- **Threat Generation**: Real, fake, and unknown threat types
- **Narrative Engine**: AI-generated event chains and chronicles
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic propagation models across domains

## Documentation
Detailed documentation is organized in the following files:
- [architecture.md](architecture.md): Core architecture and extensibility
- [threat_mechanics.md](threat_mechanics.md): Threat modeling and domain-specific details
- [world_state.md](world_state.md): World representation and faction system
- [action_system.md](action_system.md): Player actions and mechanics
- [narrative_engine.md](narrative_engine.md): Event chaining and chronicle generation
- [physics_modeling.md](physics_modeling.md): Physics simulations and propagation models
- [technical_specs.md](technical_specs.md): Technical implementation and deployment

## Getting Started
1. Install as a Progressive Web App (PWA) via browser
2. Run offline with Service Workers caching assets
3. Supports touch/mouse inputs for mobile/desktop

## Development
- **Roadmap**: v1.0 core domains with expansions via mods
- **Testing**: Automated testing for cross-domain interactions
- **Deployment**: Browser-installable PWA with optional Electron wrapper
