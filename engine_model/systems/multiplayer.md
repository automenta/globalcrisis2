## Multiplayer Event System
```typescript
interface MultiplayerEvent {
  id: string;
  type: "THREAT" | "DIPLOMACY" | "DISASTER" | "TECH_BREAKTHROUGH";
  participants: string[]; // Player IDs
  requiredRoles: FactionType[];
  timeLimit: number; // Turns to complete
  successConditions: {
    threshold: number;
    metrics: ("DAMAGE" | "CONTROL" | "KNOWLEDGE")[];
  };
  rewards: {
    factionResources: Record<FactionType, ResourcePool>;
    unlockables: string[];
  };
}

// Quantum-entangled multiplayer events
function generateEntangledEvent(players: Player[]): MultiplayerEvent {
  const factions = players.map(p => p.faction);
  return {
    id: `quantum-event-${Date.now()}`,
    type: "TECH_BREAKTHROUGH",
    participants: players.map(p => p.id),
    requiredRoles: factions,
    timeLimit: 5,
    successConditions: {
      threshold: 0.8,
      metrics: ["KNOWLEDGE"]
    },
    rewards: {
      factionResources: {
        [FactionType.TECHNOCRAT]: { intel: 500, tech: 300 },
        [FactionType.MITIGATOR]: { intel: 400, manpower: 200 },
        // ... other factions
      },
      unlockables: ["QUANTUM_COMMUNICATION"]
    }
  };
}
