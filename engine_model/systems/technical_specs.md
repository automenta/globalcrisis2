# Technical Specifications

## Implementation Details
- **Frontend**: HTML5/JavaScript PWA using:
  - Phaser for core game logic
  - Three.js for 3D visualization
  - D3.js for data dashboards
  - TensorFlow.js for AI-driven narrative generation
- **Backend**: Client-side only with:
  - IndexedDB for persistent saves
  - Web Workers for physics simulations
  - WebAssembly for performance-critical calculations
  - Quantum simulation libraries (e.g., QuSim.js)
- **Performance**:
  - LOD (Level of Detail) rendering with 4 quality levels
  - Spatial partitioning for entity management (quadtree for 2D, octree for 3D)
  - WebGPU acceleration for visualization rendering
  - Frame budget: 16ms (60 FPS target) with dynamic quality scaling
  - Dedicated physics threads for robotic swarm simulations
- **Ethics**:
  - Content warnings for sensitive scenarios (configurable)
  - Educational mode with real-world parallels and historical references
  - Inclusive design with color-blind modes and text alternatives
  - Privacy-preserving analytics with opt-in consent
  - Quantum ethics guidelines for responsible simulation
